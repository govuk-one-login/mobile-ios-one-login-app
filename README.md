This repository hosts the iOS Mobile app for Document Checking as part of Digital Identity. Details on our ways of working can be found on Confluence.

## Branching strategy and releases

This project uses a git-flow branching strategy, briefly:
- Create a new branch from `develop`
- Merge pull requests into `develop`
- At the point of preparing a new release create a `release/` branch from the specified commit in develop
- Name the branch using the appropriate semantic version for the release; for example `release/1.0.0`
  - The initial version number for the release is taken from the branch name; `v1.0.0`
  - Any subsequent pushes to the branch will increment the patch; `v1.0.1` 
- Any required fixes for the release should be pull requested into the release branch
- Once approval has been granted for the release to be published the release branch should be merged into `main`
- `main` should then be merged back into `develop`

### Conventional Commits

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) are required for each pull request to ensure that release versioning can be managed automatically.
Please ensure that you have enabled the Git hooks, so that you don't get caught out!:
```
git config core.hooksPath hooks
```
